# ***Marie Muse***
Webpage by David Luis T. Llorin

## ABOUT THE WRITER
David Llorin, under the pseudonym `Marie Muse`, has written poetry that aimed to romanticize his own life without actually experiencing it to the fullest. He found comfort in relating to other poets' metaphors because poetry for him is a line/stanza that can fully comprehend the once incomprehensible. He started writing when he 12 and was given too much time during the pandemic and started posting his spoems in Instagram around `July 2021` under the former pseudonym, _buriedutopiaa_. At first, his poetry was about a hopeless relationship with an imaginary lover until he has fully grasped that poetry can be beautiful in many ways and then, his next muse became his own existence.

> **Clémence**

`I could never own a Clémence,`
for there is no forgiveness to ready
when there is no past to steady,
I may be privileged to assume but
there was indeed nothing for me to study.

`It must be an outcry-equivalent to write this poem,`
to write about how i have engendered
one’s assumptions to have someone fall in love
with the writer of the same gender.
But— if assumption splits a native of folly
into halves then— I’d sunder in behalf.

`I could never own a Clémence,`
for there is no forgiveness to ready,
when there is no past to steady,
but in spite of the Mandela Effect of us,
in the future, I behold my trust,
a dignity-equivalent of me,
begotten for the engendering of an assumption,
for i beg for a temporary love consumption.

> **MALE VALIDATION**

`i feed off everything the males have said,`
despite its lack of accountability and the ugliness
my utensils reek,
i chewed it, but not 21 times, i’m not 21 but i don’t feel 14,
i swallowed it, but too fast, my throat’s been harassed,
i digested it, but it stayed there, imperishable even to the acids,
now, it stays afloat in my stomach, telling me i have gained masses,
telling me i couldn’t fit in my glasses, telling me not to
scratch my rashes.

`i have blamed the mercury retrograde since september,`
but i’m still in denial, and in a few days, it’ll be november,
i blamed it all, the jealousy, the greed, the hunger, the childhood
to the backward pace of the first place,
but i’ve blamed it first on the members of manhood,
but i didn’t want to be seen as not good,
so, i eat even the crumbs of their words’ food,
chewing, swallowing, digesting,
but never enough to fit to what they are suggesting.

`i want to be a man so tell me you’d be my man,`
tell me you’d assure me ‘til my life reaches the end of its span.
validate me, but if you can, sedate me too,
because i’m 14, but i feel 42.
